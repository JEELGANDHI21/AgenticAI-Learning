      "Explanation: The query \"Why is the sky blue?\" is a question that seeks to understand the underlying reason for the sky's blue color. The retrieved context \"The sky is blue because of the way sunlight interacts with the atmosphere\" is directly relevant to the query because it provides a concise and accurate explanation for the phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This context is relevant to the query for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Answer**: The context provides a direct answer to the query, stating that the interaction between sunlight and the atmosphere is the reason for the sky's blue color.\n",
      "2. **Scientific Explanation**: The context offers a scientific explanation, which is likely to satisfy the query's demand for a rational and evidence-based answer.\n",
      "3. **Brevity and Clarity**: The context is brief and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide range of audiences, from non-experts to experts in the field.\n",

      "1. **Providing a Clear Explanation**: The context provides a clear and concise explanation, which can help the user understand the underlying reason for the sky's blue color.\n",
      "2. **Satisfying Curiosity**: By providing a direct and scientific answer, the context can satisfy the user's curiosity and provide a sense of closure.\n",
      "3. **Encouraging Further Learning**: The context might also encourage the user to learn more about the interaction between sunlight and the atmosphere, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n",

      "Explanation: The provided context is not directly relevant to the query \"Why is the sky blue?\" The query is asking about the color of the sky, which is a phenomenon related to the Earth's atmosphere and the way it interacts with sunlight. On the other hand, the context provided discusses global warming, which is a separate topic related to climate change and the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context does not help answer the query because it does not provide any information about the color of the sky or the scientific principles that explain why the sky appears blue. The context is focused on a different aspect of the Earth's atmosphere, namely the impact of greenhouse gases on the climate, and does not address the optical properties of the atmosphere that determine the color of the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer the query \"Why is the sky blue?\", a more relevant context would be one that explains the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of sunlight by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere, resulting in the blue color of the sky. The provided context does not provide this information, and therefore, it is not helpful in answering the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result 3:\n",
      "Content: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce energy.\n",
      "Explanation: The context provided is not directly relevant to the query \"Why is the sky blue?\" The query is asking about the color of the sky, which is a phenomenon related to atmospheric science and physics. On the other hand, the context is discussing photosynthesis, a process related to biology and plant physiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context does not provide any information that would help answer the query about the sky's color. Photosynthesis is a process that occurs in plants and is related to how they produce energy from sunlight, but it does not explain why the sky appears blue to our eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer the query \"Why is the sky blue?\", a more relevant context would be one that discusses the scattering of light by atmospheric particles, such as the explanation that shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange) by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere, resulting in the blue color we see when we look at the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the provided context is not relevant to the query, and it would not help answer the question about the sky's color. A different context that discusses atmospheric science and the behavior of light would be more relevant and helpful in answering the query.\n",
