    "# HyDE RAG Technique - Hypothetical Document Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates the **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)** retrieval technique, an advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method that improves document retrieval by generating hypothetical answers before searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What is HyDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "HyDE is a retrieval technique that addresses a common problem in traditional RAG systems: **the semantic gap between user queries and document content**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional RAG Problem\n",
    "- User queries are often short and question-like\n",
    "- Documents contain detailed, declarative content\n",
    "- Direct similarity search may miss relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### HyDE Solution\n",
    "1. **Generate** a hypothetical answer to the user's query using an LLM\n",
    "2. **Embed** this hypothetical document\n",
    "3. **Search** for similar documents using the hypothetical document's embedding\n",
    "4. **Retrieve** the most relevant actual documents\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → LLM (Generate Hypothetical Doc) → Embed → Vector Search → Retrieve Documents\n",
    "```"
